## [Semantic Edge Detection with Diverse Deep Supervision](https://yun-liu.github.io/papers/(IJCV'2021)Semantic%20Edge%20Detection%20with%20Diverse%20Deep%20Supervision.pdf)

This repository contains the code for our IJCV paper: "Semantic Edge Detection with Diverse Deep Supervision". The code is based on the Caffe framework which is outdated now (the reviewing process lasts very very long). Hence, we only release the code for the future reference. If you want to do something about the task of semantic edge detection, [the code](https://github.com/Lavender105/DFF) for the DFF paper ("Dynamic Feature Fusion for Semantic Edge Detection", IJCAI 2019) is a good choice to start with, which is based on the popular PyTorch framework. If you really want to run our Caffe code, please prepare data like the [SEAL](https://github.com/Chrisding/seal) repository ("Simultaneous Edge Alignment and Learning", ECCV 2018), although I guess that no one would like to do so...
